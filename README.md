## Background :

At 'ALIENS-R-REAL' we have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove this things are real! And now we want to put all this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.  

We decided to make our user's live easier allowing to filter the information by date and other columns.

This is the purpose of this proyect we only use JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js.

The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* A basic HTML web page was created.

* Using Dataset provided we were able to retrieve all the informaton to the table.

* This are all the columns we show date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

* A date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Once completed the level 1 we decided to enable the web page to use multiple input parameters.

* The code was written in JavaScript and allowed the user to do multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  * date/time
  * city
  * state
  * country
  * shape
